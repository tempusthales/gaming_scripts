```

- Save the file.

The first time after adding these rewards, launch the game in Steam offline mode. Then, if you now go to the quicksilver merchant, you can unlock everything from Expedition 1 through 18. No, you can't get banned for doing this, and after the first launch in offline mode, you can return to online mode.

If you don't want to edit the file manually, I have attached the edited file in the repo.  It's a json file so if you want to see what's inside you can click on it.
